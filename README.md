# Smart-Beta-and-Portfolio-Optimization


## Objective:
The objective of this proposed portfolio is to design a portfolio that closely tracks an index, while also minimizes the portfolio variance.  This desired portfolio can match the returns of the index with less volatility with a higher risk-adjusted return (same return, lower volatility).
Smart Beta ETFs can be designed with both of these two general methods (among others): alternative weighting and minimum volatility ETF.
The Project was organized and guided by Udacity’s AI For Trading Nano Degree

## Overview¶
First, what are smart beta and alpha funds?
Smart beta has a broad meaning, but we can say in practice that when we use the universe of stocks from an index, and then apply some weighting scheme other than market cap weighting, it can be considered a type of smart beta fund. A Smart Beta portfolio generally gives investors exposure or "beta" to one or more types of market characteristics (or factors) that are believed to predict prices while giving investors a diversified broad exposure to a particular market. Smart Beta portfolios generally target momentum, earnings quality, low volatility, and dividends or some combination. Smart Beta Portfolios are generally rebalanced infrequently and follow relatively simple rules or algorithms that are passively managed. Model changes to these types of funds are also rare requiring prospectus filings with US Security and Exchange Commission in the case of US focused mutual funds or ETFs. Smart Beta portfolios are generally long-only, they do not short stocks.
In contrast, a purely alpha-focused quantitative fund may use multiple models or algorithms to create a portfolio. The portfolio manager retains discretion in upgrading or changing the types of models and how often to rebalance the portfolio in attempt to maximize performance in comparison to a stock benchmark. Managers may have discretion to short stocks in portfolios.

So, the objective of your proposed portfolio is to design a portfolio that closely tracks an index, while also minimizing the portfolio variance. Also, if this portfolio can match the returns of the index with less volatility, then it has a higher risk-adjusted return (same return, lower volatility).
Smart Beta ETFs can be designed with both of these two general methods (among others): alternative weighting and minimum volatility ETF.

## Results
The project was divided into two parts: making a smart beta portfolio with coded functions and key metrics, and then optimzing this prior portfolio to track and closely align the new portfolio to the market/index weights while lowering risk and rebalancing costs.
